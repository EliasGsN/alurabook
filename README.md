# Alura Books

This repository contains the source code of the Alura Books project, developed while learning concepts such as componentization, styled components, state management, manipulation of filters and arrays, and the use of props.

## About the Project

Alura Books is a book website created as part of the Alura web development course, where various important concepts for modern web application development were applied.

## Applied Concepts

- **Componentization:** We learned to divide our application into reusable components, making maintenance and code organization easier.

- **Styled Components:** We used styled components to style our components without the need for separate CSS files, keeping the CSS alongside the component.

- **State Management:** We implemented the concept of state to manage the application state, allowing dynamic interactions with the user, such as the search bar.

- **Manipulation of Filters and Arrays:** We used filters and arrays to manipulate and display application data dynamically, creating a functional search component.

- **Props:** We learned to pass props between components, allowing communication and customization of the components.
